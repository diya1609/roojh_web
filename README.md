## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub repository for this project.
2. Click on the `Code` button and copy the repository URL.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Use the command `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the repository to your local machine. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied.

### 2. Open the Project in Visual Studio Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to `File` > `Open Folder...` (or `Open...` on macOS).
3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository and click `Open`.

### 3. Install Dependencies

1. Once the project is open in Visual Studio Code, locate the `Terminal` menu.
2. Choose `New Terminal` from the dropdown.
3. In the terminal window that opens at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, type `npm install` and press Enter. This will install all necessary dependencies for the project. If you prefer using Yarn, type `yarn install` instead.

### 4. Start the Development Server

2. By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build for Production

1. In the terminal, type `npm run build` and press Enter to create a production build of the project. If you prefer using Yarn, type `yarn build` instead.
2. The production build will be generated in the `build` directory.

### 6. Run Tests
